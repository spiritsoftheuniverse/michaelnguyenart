                                Hello there. I am Michael Nguyen, an artist of the yesteryears. I was born in 1982. That would be nearly two decades before the internet found its way into households.
                                I went to art school for traditional arts; experimenting with mediums like an illiterate chemist. A lot of time was spent onward doing digital illustration.
                                Due to the nature of things, I had to learn all sorts of stuff from within and beyond the arts in order to function creatively.
                                Lots of processes were whittled out through the years, although what remains today are visual arts, 3d modeling/animation, audio engineering, music production, and game development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                On my downtime, I enjoy uniquely crafted video games from a time before accessibility was an option for players. 
                                I also love playing guitar, as it is a rhythmic activity which requires excessive amounts of technical ability depending on your temperament.
                                All things find their way into the spiral of meaning, no matter how big or small, so being ignorant is a tough sell for me, but apparently incredibly easy for the population at large.
                                Get that mind right.
                        </p>

                        I fell in love with the making of music because I hung out with more musicians than I did artists. Time is of the essence, and there isn't any activity more fluid for the cause than music.
                        My instrument of choice is guitar, played over compositions produced with audio samples to simulate the presence of the rest of the band. I like the genres of origin as inspiration, although what I play are bastardized versions of them all.

                        <p>
                                Kill is a 2.5d side scrolling action video game which commemorates the artistry of legacy video games while moving forward with graphical technology.
                                It ignores modern commercial takes on game design and functionality. There are no graphical reduction options, as its intent is to bring full artistic fidelity to the screen.
                                The world is designed to be a playground of infinite possibilities. Although you start somewhere, it has no ending.
                                As the player of Kill, you take on a creative approach to playing. The reward is the journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Kill is entirely non-narrative and all gameplay. The world is inspired by Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. 
                                The combat is inspired by classic fighting games with extreme technical finesse such as Marvel Super Heroes and X-men vs. Street Fighter.
                                It is not only a matter of enemy resistance or challenging obstacles. Much of the challenge is being able to execute your actions well enough to open up all the fun in the game, which are the juggle mechanics and limitless transitions of actions. 
                                It is made for technical players who love to challenge themselves to no end through self discovery and experimentation.
                                It gives you everything to be a performance artist of the future.
                        </p>

                                Video-games are incredibly important to me and are more than just something that I do for fun. Pockets of time represent games at their strongest, so there is no era of gaming that takes all. 
                                On the other hand, video games of today are not strong in their ability to provide the player with secret techniques that are only discoverable if you pay attention to your own actions.
                                This is the kind of game that I want more games to be, but the industry has shifted to a fully transparent and boring paradigm of mechanics. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                I celebrate the beauty and mechanical finesse of classic games by continuing to play them. The most astonishing titles of all will come to a surprise to most, as these games are not revered by much people at all. These titles include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>X-men vs. Street Fighter</li>
                                <li>Castlevania : Dawn of Sorrow</li>
                                <li>Final Fantasy XV</li>
                                <li>Gundam Breaker 3</li>
                                <li>Super Mario World</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                                Being the hidden gems of gaming, there is no audience waiting to watch. 
                                Then again, there is no audience for technical gameplay. People don't understand what they never discovered. 
                                However, if you stick around long enough to know me, you'll know what it means to move like a butterfly and sting like a bee.
                                I still play some games that don't have hidden techniques, such as modern Mario, but that's the extent of it.
                        </p>
