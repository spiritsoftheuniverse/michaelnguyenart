                                Hello there. I am Michael Nguyen, an artist of the yesteryears. I was born in 1982. That would be nearly two decades before the internet found its way into households.
                                I went to art school for traditional arts; experimenting with mediums like an illiterate chemist. A lot of time was spent onward doing digital illustration.
                                Due to the nature of things, I had to learn all sorts of stuff from within and beyond the arts in order to function creatively.
                                Lots of processes were whittled out through the years, although what remains today are visual arts, 3d modeling/animation, audio engineering, music production, and game development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                On my downtime, I enjoy uniquely crafted video games from a time where hidden techniques were a thing. 
                                I also love playing guitar, as it is a rhythmic activity which requires excessive amounts of technical ability depending on your temperament.
                                All things find their way into the spiral of meaning, no matter how big or small.
                                Get that mind right and come correct with those manners the best you can. 
                                Nothing makes it any easier, not even the internet.
                        </p>

                        I fell in love with the making of music because I hung out with more musicians than I did artists. Time is of the essence, and there isn't any activity more fluid for the cause than music.
                        My instrument of choice is guitar, played over compositions produced with audio samples to simulate the presence of the rest of the band. I like the genres of origin as inspiration, although what I play are bastardized versions of them all.
                        Since I have been so into creating music, I have never really had the opportunity to enjoy doing cover songs. I can't even remember my own notes, so how can I remember anyone elses? 
                        At the point of writing this, music creation has been a part of my life for half of my years of existence.

                        <p>
                                Kill is a 2.5d side scrolling action video game which commemorates the artistry of legacy video games while moving forward with graphical technology.
                                It ignores modern commercial takes on game design and functionality. There are no graphical reduction options, as its intent is to bring full artistic fidelity to the screen.
                                The world is designed to be a playground of infinite possibilities. Although you start somewhere, it has no ending.
                                As the player of Kill, you take on a creative approach to playing. The reward is the journey and the growth of your skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                In the years 2019-2021, the game was called Dreamstrata. Moving into the future, it will be called Kill again.
                                Kill is entirely non-narrative and all gameplay. The world is inspired by Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. 
                                The combat is inspired by classic fighting games with extreme technical finesse such as Marvel Super Heroes and X-men vs. Street Fighter.
                                It is not only a matter of enemy resistance or challenging obstacles. Much of the challenge is being able to execute your actions well enough to open up all the fun in the game, which are the juggle mechanics and limitless transitions of actions. 
                                It is made for technical players who love to challenge themselves to no end through self discovery and experimentation.
                                It gives you everything to be a performance artist of the future.
                        </p>

                                        you can visit the Art Gallery in the years that follow: </p>

                                        The best way to follow the current development cycle of Kill is to join my Discord server, <a class="discordLink">Michael's Studio</a>.

                        <p>
                                It's strange to say that I don't really enjoy video-games as a whole, despite growing up with them since Atari. I am a snob of hidden skills and techniques found in games that are very special in their design. These techniques in these games 
                                bring mechanical intricacy and idiosyncrasies that make them play like no other. They are classics at this point, occupying the era of the nasty 90's. Developers today do not make anything like the games of this era.
                                I celebrate the beauty and mechanical finesse of these classic games by continuing to play them. The most astonishing titles of all will come to a surprise to most, as these games are not revered by much people at all. These titles include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>X-men vs. Street Fighter</li>
                                <li>Castlevania : Dawn of Sorrow</li>
                                <li>Super Mario World</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="lineseparator"></div>
                        <p>
                                Being the hidden gems of gaming, there is no audience waiting to watch. 
                                Then again, there is no audience for technical gameplay unless people are competing for something, such as fighting game sets or speed-runs.
                                However, if you stick around long enough to know me, you'll know what it means to move like a butterfly and sting like a bee under any circumstance.
                                I don't skill up to compete with anyone. If I were to compete, it is usually against myself.
                                I play to be creatively limitless on the battlefield. Video game violence is my performance art.
                                I still play some games that don't have hidden techniques, such as modern Mario and some pretty strong 3rd person action games, but that's the extent of it.
                                These honorable mentions include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Stranger of Paradise : Final Fantasy Origin</li>
                                <li>Gundam Breaker 3</li>
                                <li>Final Fantasy XV</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                                Despite not being the most popular games in the world and at times panned for their presentation (deservingly so), 
                                each of these titles offer something more than your average game, such as speed, freedom of mobility, an abundance of offensive options, or a very unique set of controls that make them play more differently than any other of their type.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                While the single player experience offers limitless expression through power-fantasy character dominance, I really value the friendships made from the classic fighting game community where we found one another.
                                We expect technical excellence through gameplay, something that is very rare. None of the groups I've fleetingly been a part of are remotely concerned about such things. This is why my presence is not a present for them.
                                But in the case of the <a href="https://discord.gg/hvaxG56C4q">Online Arcade</a> Discord server, we gift one another with ass whoopings, all with the utmost respect, grace, and finesse. 
                                When I show myself to people who are begrudging of the gift, it's too uncomfortable to bear, and so I bail. Luckily, the fighting game community is a wonderful place that is not about that kind of shit.
